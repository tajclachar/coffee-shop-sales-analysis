☕ Coffee Shop Sales Analysis

End-to-End Business Analytics Project

This project analyzes real-world–style transactional data from a fictional New York coffee chain to uncover sales trends, identify high-performing stores, and recommend data-driven strategies for staffing and marketing.

It’s designed to simulate a real analytics case study — clean code, clear visuals, and instantly viewable results.
